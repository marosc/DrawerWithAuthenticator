# DrawerWithAuthenticator

For education purposes I give to you example demo how to implement :

  - **Material Drawer with Toolbar**
  - **Authenticator**
  - 
### Version
1.0

### Tech

InfiniteRecycleView uses a number of library to work properly:
* **de.hdodenhof:circleimageview:1.2.1**
* **com.google.code.gson:gson:2.2.2**
* **com.android.support:support-v4:22.2.1**

And of course DrawerWithAuthenticator itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/marosc/DrawerWithAuthenticator) on GitHub.

### Installation
You need Git to download repository, or download ZIP archive

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] DrawerWithAuthenticator
```

You need Android SDK and Android Studio (or Eclipse ADT, ...) to build project.
